					1. CHOOSE ONE PERSON TO SERVE AS THE REFEREE<br>
					The referee will spin the spinner, call out the moves, and supervise the game.<br>Remember to switch off so that everyone gets a chance to play. Some players may prefer to spend more time on the mat, while others may be content to sit back and call the shots.<br>
					2. TAKE YOUR SHOES OFF AND SPIN THE WHEEL<br>The referee spins the needle, and then calls out the color and body part on which the needle lands. All players must obey this direction.<br>For example: "Right foot, green!" or "Left hand, blue!"<br>
					3. ELBOWS TOUCHING MAT ARE NOT ALOWED.<br>Last man standing on his foots and/or hands is winner.<br>
					4. ENJOY!
